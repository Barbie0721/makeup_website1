      <h2>My Beauty Journey - From Stage Lights to Daily Glow</h2>
      <p>My serious journey into makeup began when I joined the dance club in college. Every time we had a performance, I had to rely on others to help me with my stage makeup. But before shows, everyone was busy preparing themselves, and I didn't want to keep bothering others. I also feared that if no one had time to help, I would have to go on stage feeling insecure and unprepared. That fear motivated me to start learning makeup seriously — from everyday looks to special performance styles.</p>
      <p>I taught myself by watching countless tutorials online, practicing every day. At first, it was frustrating: my makeup never looked quite right, and something always felt off. But little by little, with daily practice and adjustments, I got closer to the looks I envisioned.</p>
      <p>Now, my friends often compliment my makeup skills, and many even ask me for tips. I'm especially inspired by Korean beauty trends — I love referencing Korean brands and girl group stage makeup for ideas. More than just a skill, makeup has become a joyful part of my daily life. Depending on my mood or outfit, I enjoy creating different looks to express myself.</p>
      <p>Through makeup, I've found confidence, creativity, and a hobby that I truly love. One day, I hope to make it not just a passion, but something I'm truly exceptional at.</p>
